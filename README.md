I'm Volkan, a software engineer specializing in computer graphics, parallel & high performance computing with some video game industry experience.

I'm into science, technology, music, games and traveling around.

In computing, I'm into real-time and high-performance applications, CPU & GPU performance optimizations, realistic rendering and hardware architecture.

----


ðŸ”­ I also enjoy building stuff, currently working on [VQEngine, a real-time multi-threaded DirectX12 Renderer with HDR display support](https://github.com/vilbeyli/VQEngine/)

ðŸ’¬ Albeit rarely, I do post about programming and graphics on my [technical blog](https://vilbeyli.github.io/).
