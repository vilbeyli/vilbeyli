### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello! I'm Volkan, a software engineer specializing in computer graphics, parallel & high performance computing with some video game industry experience.

In general, I'm into science, technology, music, games and sometimes traveling around.

In computing, I'm into real-time applications, CPU & GPU performance optimizations, realistic rendering and hardware architecture.

ðŸ”­ I also enjoy building stuff 
  
  - Currently working on a [DX12 Rendering Engine](https://github.com/vilbeyli/VQE/) with a focus on multi-threaded architecture
  - Previously built a [DX11 Physically-Based Renderer](https://github.com/vilbeyli/VQEngine/)

ðŸ’¬ I've recently started writing on my [blog](https://vilbeyli.github.io/) again - I try to keep it technical.
